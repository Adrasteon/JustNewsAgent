## 📋 Quality Standards Reference

### Minimum Requirements
| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Overall Quality Score** | >90% | ✅ 100.0/100 |
| **Description Length** | 150+ characters | ✅ 202.0 avg |
| **Tagging Coverage** | 100% | ✅ 100% |
| **Quality Issues** | 0 | ✅ 0 |

### Quality Score Formula
```
Final Score = (Description Score + Tagging Score) / 2 - Issue Penalty
- Description Score: min(100, avg_length / 2)
- Tagging Score: (tagged_docs / total_docs) * 100
- Issue Penalty: issues_count * 5 points
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Quality score drops below 90%
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run detailed quality analysis
python quality_monitor.py

# Check for missing tags or short descriptions
# Fix issues immediately
# Re-run quality check to verify
```

#### Issue: Version control not tracking changes
**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct directory
cd /home/adra/justnewsagent/JustNewsAgent/docs

# Check version control status
python version_control.py report --days 1

# Create new snapshot if needed
python version_control.py snapshot --author "Your Name"
```

#### Issue: Automation scripts not running
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check script permissions
ls -la docs/docs/*.sh
