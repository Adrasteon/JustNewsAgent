    # duplicate declarations that can confuse pip's resolver. Keep any agent-
    # specific additions in `requirements.txt` so they can be edited independently.

# Notes:
# - The pip-only requirements are defined in `requirements.txt`.
# - RAPIDS packages (if needed) should be added here with explicit pins separately.
