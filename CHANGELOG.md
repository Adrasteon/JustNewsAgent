### ✅ Runtime / Operations
- Wire MCP Bus lifespan into the FastAPI app so readiness is reported correctly on startup (`agents/mcp_bus/main.py`).
- Add consistent `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to `dashboard` and `balancer` agents for uniform service probes (`agents/dashboard/main.py`, `agents/balancer/balancer.py`).
- Update `start_services_daemon.sh` to start MCP Bus from its new `agents/mcp_bus` location and ensure log paths point at `agents/mcp_bus`.
- Fix several small import/path issues to make per-agent entrypoints import reliably when started from the repository root (`agents/newsreader/main.py`, others).

### 🔎 Verification & Notes
- Confirmed via automated health-sweep that MCP Bus now returns `{"ready": true}` and all agents expose `/health` and `/ready` (ports 8000—8011).
- Stopped stale processes and restarted agents to ensure updated code was loaded.

### 🛠️ How to test locally
1. Start services: `./start_services_daemon.sh`
2. Run the health-check sweep: `for p in {8000..8011}; do curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:$p/health; curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:$p/ready; done`
