# JustNewsAgent Script Ecosystem

This directory contains the organized script ecosystem for JustNewsAgent operations, maintenance, and development.

```

## Categories

### admin/
Scripts for administrative tasks and system configuration.

- `manage_secrets.py` - Manage application secrets and credentials

### deploy/
Scripts for deployment, database setup, and infrastructure provisioning.

- `setup_postgres.sh` - PostgreSQL installation and configuration
- `init_database.py` - Database schema initialization and user setup

### dev/
Scripts for development environment setup and tooling.

- `setup_dev_environment.sh` - Development environment configuration

### maintenance/
Scripts for system maintenance, monitoring, and health checks.

- `validate_versions.py` - Version validation and compliance checking

### ops/
Scripts for operational tasks and service management.

- `start_services_daemon.sh` - Start all JustNewsAgent services
- `stop_services.sh` - Stop all JustNewsAgent services
- `download_agent_models.py` - Download and setup AI models

### common/
Shared utilities and frameworks used by all scripts.

- `script_framework.py` - Common script framework with logging, error handling, and configuration

## Usage

All scripts follow consistent patterns:

### Python Scripts
```bash
# Basic usage
python scripts/refactor/category/script.py

# With options
python scripts/refactor/category/script.py --verbose --log-level DEBUG

# Dry run mode (where supported)
python scripts/refactor/category/script.py --dry-run
```

### Shell Scripts
```bash
# Basic usage
./scripts/refactor/category/script.sh

# With options (varies by script)
./scripts/refactor/category/script.sh --help
```

## Common Options

All Python scripts support these standard options:
- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}` - Set logging verbosity
- `--log-file FILE` - Log to file in addition to console
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be done without making changes
- `--verbose/-v` - Enable verbose output
- `--quiet/-q` - Suppress non-error output

## Environment Variables

Scripts use these common environment variables:
- `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database configuration
- `MODEL_STORE_ROOT` - Model storage directory
- `BASE_MODEL_DIR` - Agent model cache directory
- `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` - Conda environment name

## Error Handling

All scripts include comprehensive error handling:
- Standardized logging with timestamps and levels
- Graceful failure with informative error messages
- Environment validation before execution
- Keyboard interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)

## Development Guidelines

When adding new scripts:

1. **Categorize properly** - Place scripts in the appropriate category directory
2. **Use the framework** - Python scripts should use `ScriptFramework` from `common/script_framework.py`
3. **Document thoroughly** - Include docstrings and usage examples
4. **Handle errors** - Implement proper error handling and logging
5. **Test scripts** - Add automated tests for critical functionality
6. **Follow conventions** - Use consistent naming and option patterns

## Migration Notes

This organized structure replaces the previous flat `scripts/` directory. Legacy scripts have been:

- **Moved**: Essential scripts moved to appropriate categories
- **Archived**: Obsolete/experimental scripts moved to `archive/`
- **Removed**: Duplicate or undocumented scripts removed entirely

For legacy script references, check the `archive/` directory or git history.
