# Readme: Bootstrap Models

This document documents the model bootstrap utilities and helper scripts used to
prepare model artifacts for the repository. It was added automatically to
resolve a broken catalogue reference (see `docs/docs_catalogue_v2.json`) and
should be reviewed and expanded by a maintainer.

Primary script: `scripts/bootstrap_models.py`

Suggested content to add:

- Purpose and overview of the bootstrap_models helper
- Required environment variables and configuration
- Example usage and commands to download or prepare models
- Troubleshooting and common failure modes
- Notes about storing model artifacts and per-agent model caches

If this placeholder was created in error, remove it and update the catalogue
entry to point to the correct documentation path.
