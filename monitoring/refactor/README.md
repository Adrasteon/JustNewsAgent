# JustNewsAgent Unified Observability Platform Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive observability platform that will replace the current fragmented monitoring setup with a unified, production-ready system supporting centralized logging, advanced metrics collection, distributed tracing, and real-time monitoring dashboards.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Capabilities
- **Basic Prometheus/Grafana Stack**: Docker Compose setup with Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana, Node Exporter, cAdvisor, and DCGM Exporter
- **Metrics Collection**: Basic Prometheus client integration in `common/metrics.py` with HTTP request metrics, system resources, and GPU monitoring
- **Alert Rules**: Comprehensive alerting rules for service health, performance, and business metrics
- **Dashboards**: Three basic Grafana dashboards (system overview, content pipeline, GPU monitoring)
- **Configuration**: Static IP-based service discovery in Prometheus configuration
- **✅ Centralized Logging**: **COMPLETED** - Full centralized logging system with structured logging, aggregation, storage, and analysis

### Identified Gaps
- **Distributed Tracing**: Empty `tracing.py` file with no tracing implementation
- **Service Mesh Integration**: No service discovery or mesh-level observability
- **Advanced Metrics**: Limited custom metrics and performance profiling capabilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Basic dashboards without advanced visualization or alerting
- **Compliance Monitoring**: No audit logging or regulatory compliance tracking
- **Performance Profiling**: No detailed performance analysis or bottleneck identification
