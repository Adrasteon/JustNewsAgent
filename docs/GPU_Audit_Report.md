        # Request with model type for optimal batch sizing
        allocation = request_agent_gpu(f"{agent_name}_agent", memory_gb=X, model_type="embedding")
        if allocation['status'] == 'allocated':
            self.gpu_device = allocation['gpu_device']
            self.batch_size = allocation['batch_size']  # Optimized batch size
            self.device = torch.device(f"cuda:{self.gpu_device}")
        else:
            self.device = torch.device("cpu")
    
    # Use allocated device with optimized batch processing
    model = pipeline("task", device=self.gpu_device if self.gpu_device else -1)

def cleanup(self):
    # Enhanced resource release with memory cleanup
    if GPU_MANAGER_AVAILABLE and self.gpu_device is not None:
        release_agent_gpu(f"{agent_name}_agent")
        # Additional memory cleanup

```

### Memory Optimization Integration
```python
# Embedding helper integration with GPU manager
from agents.common.embedding import get_shared_embedding_model, get_embedding_memory_stats

# Optimized model loading with GPU coordination
model = get_shared_embedding_model("all-MiniLM-L6-v2", device=device)

# Memory usage monitoring
stats = get_embedding_memory_stats()
print(f"Total memory usage: {stats['total_memory_mb']}MB")
print(f"Cache hit ratio: {stats['cache_hit_ratio']}")
