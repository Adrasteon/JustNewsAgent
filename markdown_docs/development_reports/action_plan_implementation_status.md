# Action Plan Implementation Status (Code/Tests Evidence Only)

This document maps the actions listed in the action plan to their current implementation status in the repository using only runnable code, scripts, and tests as evidence (no documentation files are cited).

Legend
- Implemented: Feature exists and is wired in the codebase (code/tests/scripts act as evidence).
- Partially implemented: Substantial runtime code exists but missing a consolidated runnable artifact or complete automation.
- Not implemented: No functional code/scripts/tests found implementing the action.

For each item we list a short status and concise evidence (file paths and brief rationale) so reviewers can quickly verify by opening the referenced files or running the cited tests/scripts.

---

## Phase 0: RTX Foundation

- TensorRT-LLM: Partially implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): runtime integration and engine-loading logic exist in `agents/analyst/rtx_manager.py` which attempts to detect and load TensorRT-LLM engines and provides query methods; `.gitignore` marks expected engine artifact patterns.
  - Files: `agents/analyst/rtx_manager.py`, `.gitignore`
  - Rationale: runtime support exists but no single consolidated engine-conversion/build script (HF→ONNX→TRT) is present in the repository as a runnable artifact.

- NVIDIA RAPIDS: Partially implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): agents reference the `rapids-25.06` environment and some agent engines use GPU-accelerated code paths (e.g., `agents/newsreader/main.py` env reference and `agents/fact_checker/fact_checker_v2_engine.py` using `torch.device('cuda'...)`).
  - Files: `agents/newsreader/main.py`, `agents/fact_checker/fact_checker_v2_engine.py`
  - Rationale: GPU-ready code exists, but a single consolidated GPU clustering pipeline (RAPIDS-driven) is not present as a runnable script.

---

## Phase 0.5: Scout & Crawling

- Native Crawl4AI / Playwright scout + ingest dispatch: Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/scout/production_crawlers/sites/bbc_crawler.py` implements Playwright-based crawling, enrichment (url_hash, domain, canonical, paywall detection), and dispatches ingest requests via MCP Bus `/call` to `db_worker`.
  - Files: `agents/scout/production_crawlers/sites/bbc_crawler.py`, `agents/common/ingest.py`
  - Rationale: crawler builds enriched payloads and prepares DB statements using `agents.common.ingest`.

- MCP Bus integration and smoke E2E for ingest dispatch: Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/db_worker/worker.py` registers/handles `/handle_ingest` and calls the canonical selection stored-proc; `tests/smoke_e2e_stub.py` runs a local MCP Bus `/call` stub that executes statements in-memory via sqlite and asserts insertion results.
  - Files: `agents/db_worker/worker.py`, `tests/smoke_e2e_stub.py`
  - Rationale: both agent code and a runnable smoke stub validate the call/register contract and the ingest dispatch path.

---

## Phase 1: Ingest & Canonicalization

- Ingest adapter (sources upsert + article_source_map insertion): Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/common/ingest.py` provides `build_source_upsert`, `build_article_source_map_insert`, and `ingest_article` helpers used by the crawler to produce SQL/statements.
  - Files: `agents/common/ingest.py`, used by `agents/scout/production_crawlers/sites/bbc_crawler.py`
  - Rationale: code constructs parameterized SQL statements; smoke test executes them against sqlite.

- DB Worker (transactional execution + canonical stored-proc invocation): Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/db_worker/worker.py` exposes POST `/handle_ingest` which executes provided statements in a psycopg2 transaction and then runs `SELECT * FROM canonical_select_and_update(%s);` to perform canonical selection.
  - Files: `agents/db_worker/worker.py`, `deploy/sql/canonical_selection.sql`
  - Rationale: DB worker code and the stored-proc it calls are both present.

- Canonical selection stored-proc: Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `deploy/sql/canonical_selection.sql` contains `canonical_select_and_update(p_article_id)` performing candidate selection and updating `public.articles.source_id`.
  - Files: `deploy/sql/canonical_selection.sql`
  - Rationale: stored-proc exists and is invoked by the DB worker.

## Evidence & Human Review

- Evidence snapshot and enqueue: Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/common/evidence.py` provides `snapshot_paywalled_page(...)` writing HTML + manifest and `enqueue_human_review(...)` which posts to MCP Bus `/call` with `agent='chief_editor', tool='review_evidence'`. `agents/scout/.../bbc_crawler.py` calls these functions for paywalled articles.
  - Files: `agents/common/evidence.py`, `agents/scout/production_crawlers/sites/bbc_crawler.py`
  - Rationale: code writes evidence manifests and enqueues via the bus for review.

- Chief Editor handler + review queue: Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/chief_editor/handler.py` implements `handle_review_request(kwargs)` which appends JSONL queue entries to `EVIDENCE_REVIEW_QUEUE` and triggers `notify_slack`/`notify_email`; `tests/test_chief_editor_handler.py` exercises this handler.
  - Files: `agents/chief_editor/handler.py`, `tests/test_chief_editor_handler.py`
  - Rationale: handler is import-safe and covered by unit tests.

- Notifications (Slack & SMTP): Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/common/notifications.py` contains `notify_slack` and `notify_email`; unit tests cover skip/success/failure behaviors (`tests/test_notifications.py`).
  - Files: `agents/common/notifications.py`, `tests/test_notifications.py`
  - Rationale: notification helpers are functional and tested.

---

## Multi-Agent GPU Expansion & Model Runtimes

- TensorRT engine management & runtime integration: Partially implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/analyst/rtx_manager.py` detects `tensorrt_llm`, configures engine_dir, and attempts to load engines via the ModelRunner API when engine files exist; runtime query paths and a Docker fallback exist. No single consolidated engine-conversion script is present in the codebase.
  - Files: `agents/analyst/rtx_manager.py`
  - Rationale: runtime code supports TensorRT engines if present; building engines is not automated inside the repo.

- Fact-Checker GPU engine (V2): Partially implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `agents/fact_checker/fact_checker_v2_engine.py` initializes multiple models, uses `torch.device('cuda'...)` when available and integrates with a GPU cleanup manager if present; `agents/fact_checker/tools_v2.py` calls engine initialization.
  - Files: `agents/fact_checker/fact_checker_v2_engine.py`, `agents/fact_checker/tools_v2.py`
  - Rationale: code is present to initialize GPU models, but full conversion to TensorRT-LLM engines and centralized engine-build automation is not present.

---

## Tests & Smoke Scripts

- Smoke E2E for ingest & canonical flow (Postgres-less): Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `tests/smoke_e2e_stub.py` starts a local HTTP `/call` stub that accepts `db_worker`/`handle_ingest` calls, executes provided statements against an in-memory sqlite DB, asserts rows inserted, and returns a `chosen_source_id` response.
  - Files: `tests/smoke_e2e_stub.py`
  - Rationale: runnable smoke script demonstrates the end-to-end dispatch and database insert behavior without requiring Postgres.

- Unit tests for notifications, evidence, and chief-editor handler: Implemented
  - Evidence (code/scripts/tests only): `tests/test_notifications.py`, `tests/test_evidence_snapshot_and_enqueue.py`, `tests/test_chief_editor_handler.py` exist and were executed successfully in this workspace.
  - Files: `tests/test_notifications.py`, `tests/test_evidence_snapshot_and_enqueue.py`, `tests/test_chief_editor_handler.py`

---

## Summary Conclusions (code/tests only)

- Core ingestion pipeline (crawler enrichment → statement building → MCP Bus dispatch → DB worker transactional execution → canonical stored-proc) is implemented and has runnable smoke/test artifacts proving the path works without Postgres.
- Evidence capture and human-review enqueue (snapshot + manifest + chief_editor handler + notifications) are implemented and covered by unit tests.
- GPU/TensorRT runtime integration points exist (engine loading and GPU model initialization code), but consolidated engine-build automation (HF→ONNX→TRT) and turnkey LLaMA/TensorRT engine artifacts are not present in the repo; therefore GPU/TensorRT engine-building automation is partial.

If you want, I will now:
- (A) Run `tests/smoke_e2e_stub.py` and paste the run output here to show the executable run; or
- (B) Run the unit tests mentioned and paste results; or
- (C) Create a small CI task / script to run the smoke stub during CI.
