# Tomotopy: Online LDA with Dynamic Topic Capabilities

**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Topic:** Advanced Topic Modeling for JustNewsAgent  
**Focus:** Tomotopy's Online LDA and Dynamic Topic Modeling

---

## Overview

Tomotopy is a Python library for topic modeling that provides **true online learning capabilities** through its Online LDA implementation and **dynamic topic evolution** tracking through its Dynamic Topic Model (DTM). Unlike batch-oriented topic models, Tomotopy is specifically designed for streaming data and temporal analysis.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Online LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

**What it is:** A probabilistic topic modeling algorithm that can learn incrementally from streaming data without requiring the entire corpus to be available at once.

**Key Features:**
- **Incremental Learning**: Add documents one-by-one using `add_doc()`
- **Continuous Adaptation**: Topics evolve as new data arrives
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes data in mini-batches rather than loading everything
- **Streaming Support**: Designed for continuous data streams

**How it works:**
```python
import tomotopy as tp

# Create online LDA model
lda = tp.LDAModel(k=10, alpha=0.1, eta=0.01)

# Add documents incrementally (streaming)
lda.add_doc(['machine', 'learning', 'algorithms'])
lda.add_doc(['artificial', 'intelligence', 'systems'])
lda.add_doc(['neural', 'networks', 'deep', 'learning'])

# Train incrementally
lda.train(iter=50)
```

**Parameters:**
- `k`: Number of topics
- `alpha`: Document-topic distribution concentration parameter
- `eta`: Topic-word distribution concentration parameter

---

### 2. Dynamic Topic Model (DTM)

**What it is:** An extension of LDA that models how topics change and evolve over time periods (time slices).

**Key Features:**
- **Temporal Evolution**: Tracks topic changes across time periods
- **Topic Drift Detection**: Identifies how topic meanings shift over time
- **Emerging Topics**: Detects new topics appearing in later time periods
- **Fading Topics**: Identifies topics that become less relevant

**Use Cases for News:**
- Track how "COVID-19" topic evolved from health crisis to economic impact
- Monitor political campaign topics changing over election cycles
- Analyze how technology topics shift from "blockchain" to "Web3" to "crypto"

## Technical Advantages

### Online Learning Benefits

1. **True Streaming Processing**
   - Unlike BERTopic's `partial_fit()` which still requires batch processing
   - Tomotopy can handle truly continuous data streams
   - No need to accumulate documents before retraining

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - C++ backend provides excellent performance
   - Processes documents incrementally without storing entire corpus
   - Suitable for very large, growing datasets

3. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Learning rates automatically adjust over time
   - Topics naturally evolve with new data patterns
   - No manual intervention required for topic updates

### Dynamic Modeling Benefits

1. **Temporal Awareness**
   - Models explicitly account for time in topic evolution
   - Can predict future topic trends
   - Handles seasonal patterns in news topics

2. **Topic Lifecycle Management**
   - Birth: New topics emerging
   - Evolution: Existing topics changing meaning
   - Death: Topics becoming irrelevant
   - Merging/Splitting: Topics combining or dividing

## Integration Options for JustNewsAgent

### Option 1: Complementary Usage
```
BERTopic (Initial Clustering) → Tomotopy (Evolution Tracking)
```
- Use BERTopic for high-quality initial topic discovery
- Use Tomotopy Online LDA for continuous adaptation
- Combine strengths: BERTopic's semantic quality + Tomotopy's streaming capability

### Option 2: Dual-Model Architecture
```
Static Topics (BERTopic) + Dynamic Topics (Tomotopy)
├── BERTopic: Stable, semantic topic representations
└── Tomotopy: Evolving topic trends and patterns
```

### Option 3: Streaming Pipeline
```
News Stream → Tomotopy Online LDA → Topic Evolution Database
                                      ↓
                           BERTopic Validation → Final Topics
```

## Implementation Example

```python
class DynamicTopicTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Online LDA for streaming updates
        self.online_lda = tp.LDAModel(k=20, alpha=0.1, eta=0.01)
        
        # DTM for temporal evolution
        self.dtm_model = tp.DTModel(k=15)
        
        # Topic evolution history
        self.topic_history = []
        
    def process_news_stream(self, news_articles):
        """Process streaming news articles"""
        for article in news_articles:
            # Preprocess text
            words = self.preprocess_text(article['content'])
            
            # Add to online LDA
            self.online_lda.add_doc(words)
            
            # Periodic training
            if len(self.online_lda.docs) % 100 == 0:
                self.online_lda.train(iter=10)
                self._track_topic_evolution()
    
    def analyze_temporal_evolution(self, time_periods):
        """Analyze how topics evolved across time periods"""
        # Use DTM to model temporal patterns
        # Implementation would organize documents by time slices
        pass
    
    def _track_topic_evolution(self):
        """Record current topic state for evolution analysis"""
        current_topics = []
        for topic_id in range(self.online_lda.k):
            words = self.online_lda.get_topic_words(topic_id, top_n=10)
            current_topics.append(words)
        
        self.topic_history.append({
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'topics': current_topics,
            'document_count': len(self.online_lda.docs)
        })
