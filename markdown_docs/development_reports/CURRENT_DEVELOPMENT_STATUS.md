    url: str,
    max_depth: int = 3,          # User requested
    max_pages: int = 100,        # User requested
    word_count_threshold: int = 500,  # User requested
    quality_threshold: float = 0.6,   # Configurable
    analyze_content: bool = True      # Scout Intelligence
):
    # BestFirstCrawlingStrategy implementation
    strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=max_depth,
        max_pages=max_pages,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([

    )
    
    # Scout Intelligence analysis
    if intelligence_available and scout_engine and analyze_content:
        analysis = scout_engine.comprehensive_content_analysis(content, url)
        scout_score = analysis.get("scout_score", 0.0)
        
        # Quality filtering
        if scout_score >= quality_threshold:
            # Enhanced result with Scout Intelligence
