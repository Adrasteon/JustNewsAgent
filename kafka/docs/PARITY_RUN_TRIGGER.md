# Parity E2E Trigger

This no-op file was added to trigger a pull request so the parity E2E workflow runs.

It intentionally contains no functional code â€” it is used to create a lightweight PR
that exercises the CI parity-e2e job and produces artifacts for inspection.

Remove this file after the run if desired.
